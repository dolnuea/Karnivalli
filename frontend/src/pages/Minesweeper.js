/**
 * The goal of the game is to find all the mines on the board.
You reveal mines by clicking the cells, if you reveal a mine you lose.
If you reveal a cell without mine it will show number of mines surrounding the cell.
You can flag a field by right clicking it.
You win the game if you are able to reveal all the cells that is not a mine or you have flagged all the cells that is a mine.
In the current implementation the game is over when you reveal all squares that are mine free.
No flagging yet
